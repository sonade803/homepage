        <p>I've always been an art history nerd, but more for the architecture aspect. Before I decided on graphic design, I heavily debated going into architecture because of my admiration for various types of housing designs I had come across when I was younger.  I've learned art history here at VCU and AP European history in high school about the importance of the Renaissance and its impact on art movements going forward, and am particularly interested in the architecture and design part of what they were doing at this time. <br><br>
            <!-- br thing allows for line breaks as well -->
            I grew up watching This Old House and reading home design magazines, as my dad is very into home improvement and me being the artist of the family automatically made me a participant in every one of his projects. I've had my own smaller scale projects with architecture helping my dad redesign the exterior and interior of our house.</p>
